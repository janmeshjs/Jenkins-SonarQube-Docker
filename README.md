## Features

Continuous Integration: Jenkins is used to automate the build process and deploy changes to the Docker server when new code is pushed to the GitHub repository.

Code Quality Analysis: SonarQube performs static code analysis, identifying bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells, helping maintain high code quality.

Dockerized Deployment: The static website is hosted on a Docker server, ensuring consistency and portability across different environments.
